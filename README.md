## ◈ What is AladdinAI?

I believe the next wave of AI adoption won't happen in shared clouds. It will happen in companies that need **control over their data, their models, and their customer relationships.**

AladdinAI is the platform that makes that possible — without building everything from scratch.

> **Status:** actively developed. Most features are wired end-to-end and usable locally. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## ◈ What's inside

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agents** | Per-user agents with their own model, system prompt, tool set, and safety stack (NemoGuard / Llama-Guard, PII redaction via GLiNER) |
| **Multi-Agent Swarm** | Orchestration of autonomous sub-agents collaborating to resolve complex multi-step user intents. See [`docs/adr/0011-multi-agent-swarm-and-tools.md`](docs/adr/0011-multi-agent-swarm-and-tools.md) |
| **Memory** | Private + shared stores with vector search (MongoDB Atlas + NIM embeddings). Every recall and write decision is logged via pluggable Gates |
| **CRM** | Contacts, deals, activities. Every inbound message is auto-attributed to a contact and logged to the activity timeline |
| **Orders & Sales** | Product catalog, orders with validated delivery lifecycle, and status history tracked in activity metadata. See [`docs/guides/ORDERS.md`](docs/guides/ORDERS.md) and [`docs/adr/0008`](docs/adr/0008-orders-status-history-in-activity-metadata.md) |
| **Channels** | Telegram, WhatsApp (Cloud API), SMS, IMAP/SMTP email. Outgoing webhooks for fan-out |
| **Voice** | Speak to agents and hear replies — browser capture → NVIDIA Riva ASR + ffmpeg transcoding. See [`docs/adr/0007`](docs/adr/0007-voice-pipeline-riva.md) |
| **Documents** | Upload PDF, Excel (`.xlsx`), CSV, JSON, and text — auto-chunked and indexed into vector memory for recall |
| **Office tools** | Agents read and write real files via tools — Excel (`excel_*`) and outbound email (`send_email` over SMTP) |
| **Meta-Search Engine** | Native agent meta-search engine and universal tool discovery routing queries. See [`docs/adr/0010-native-agent-meta-search.md`](docs/adr/0010-native-agent-meta-search.md) |
| **Terminal** | Browser-based terminals (ttyd local shell, wetty SSH) for remote server management |
| **Triggers** | Cron-scheduled fan-out tasks via APScheduler, per-agent model overrides, fallback chains across providers |
| **Evaluation Harness** | Golden Set testing framework for self-forging agent layers to prevent regressions. See [`docs/adr/0009-golden-set-and-harness.md`](docs/adr/0009-golden-set-and-harness.md) |
| **Infrastructure** | Manage LLM providers, MongoDB clusters, cloud VMs (SSH), and BentoML deployments from the UI |
| **UI & Command Palette** | Fluid chat interface, Telegram-style audio player, global fuzzy search Command Palette (`Cmd+K`), and 14 universal layout-agnostic `Alt+*` keyboard shortcuts. See [`docs/UI_FEATURE_GUIDE.md`](docs/UI_FEATURE_GUIDE.md) |

## ◈ How memory works

![Memory architecture](docs/memory_architecture.svg)

Every fact is evaluated by NemoGuard before it is written.  
Retrieval uses MongoDB Atlas Vector Search — semantic, not keyword.
---
## ◈ Built on sovereign-grade open infrastructure

<br/>

> **NVIDIA NIM** — LLM inference and embeddings on-prem or in any cloud. No dependency on shared inference APIs. Every agent routes to a NIM endpoint, making the entire inference layer sovereign by default.

> **MongoDB Atlas** — Long-term agentic memory with Atlas Vector Search. Handles both structured data (CRM, activity timelines) and the vector layer (semantic memory recall) in a single platform. No separate vector DB to sync.
> 
> *Backed by [MongoDB for Startups](https://www.mongodb.com/startups) — $500 in Atlas credits to remove infrastructure barriers for the first 8 months.*

> **BentoML** — Deploy and scale custom tools and local LLMs within your own infrastructure. Swap, scale, or version models directly from the AladdinAI UI — without touching the codebase.

---

## ◈ Quick start

One command — pulls prebuilt images from GHCR (multi-arch: `amd64` + `arm64`), generates a `.env` with cryptographically-secure secrets, and brings up the full stack:

```bash
npx aladdin-ai
```

```
✓ Services running
  Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  Backend:  http://localhost:8000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, register a user, and land on the dashboard.
Add at least one **LLM Provider** under *Settings → LLM Providers* before creating agents.

### Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (macOS / Windows) or `docker` + `docker compose` (Linux)
- Node.js 18+ (just to run `npx`)

### Day-to-day commands

```bash
npx aladdin-ai up               # start services
npx aladdin-ai down             # stop services
npx aladdin-ai restart backend  # restart one service
npx aladdin-ai logs -f          # tail logs
npx aladdin-ai update           # pull latest images and recreate
npx aladdin-ai doctor           # diagnose setup issues
```

See [`cli/README.md`](cli/README.md) for the full command reference.

---

## ◈ Development setup

For contributors who want to modify the code rather than just run it:

```bash
npx aladdin-ai init --source
# or manually:
git clone https://github.com/aliyevaladddin/AladdinAI.git
cd AladdinAI
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

For a non-Docker workflow with hot-reload:

```bash
make install           # creates .venv, installs Python deps
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
make migrate           # apply Alembic migrations
make dev-backend       # FastAPI on :8000 with --reload
make dev-frontend      # Next.js on :3000 with --reload
```

---

## ◈ Tech stack

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, sonner |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2 (async), Alembic, APScheduler |
| **Storage** | SQLite or Postgres (relational), MongoDB Atlas (vectors) |
| **LLM access** | Provider-agnostic — NIM, OpenAI, Anthropic, local via BentoML |
| **Auth** | JWT (HS256) with access + refresh tokens |
| **Realtime** | Server-sent events for chat streaming |

---

## ◈ Roadmap

- **Marketplace** — shareable agent templates, tool packs, and gate configurations
- **Multi-tenant SaaS mode** — deploy AladdinAI as a hosted service for your own customers, with per-tenant isolation and billing hooks
- **Advanced observability** — full trace view per agent turn: memory reads, gate decisions, tool calls, model latency
- **Expanded channels** — native mobile push, browser extension
- **One-click cloud deploy** — pre-configured Terraform modules for AWS, GCP, and Azure. Full stack up in under 10 minutes

```

---

## ◈ Production notes

- **`JWT_SECRET`** — replace with `openssl rand -hex 32` before deploying. Anyone who knows it can mint tokens for any user.
- **Database** — switch `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres. SQLite is fine locally but not for multi-worker deployments.
- **Frontend URL** — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the public backend URL the browser will reach.
- **API keys** — provider keys live in the database (encrypted at rest, set via the UI), not in `.env`.

---

## ◈ Operations

### Logs

```bash
npx aladdin-ai logs -f             # tail all services
npx aladdin-ai logs -f backend     # backend only
npx aladdin-ai logs -f frontend    # frontend only
```

Every agent turn is traceable: memory reads, gate decisions, tool calls, and model latency are logged to the backend. Use `GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/gates/log` for structured gate decisions, or open the **Traces** tab on an agent page for a full per-turn view (input, tool calls, iterations, outcome, reward). Raw turn traces are also available via `GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/traces`.

### Upgrades

```bash
npx aladdin-ai update              # pull latest images, recreate containers
make migrate                       # apply any new database migrations
```

Images are versioned and tagged. The CLI always pulls the same tag it was installed with unless you pass `--tag latest` explicitly. Database migrations run automatically on backend startup via Alembic.

### Failure recovery

If a service crashes, Docker Compose restarts it automatically (`restart: unless-stopped`). To restart manually:

```bash
npx aladdin-ai restart backend
npx aladdin-ai restart frontend
npx aladdin-ai doctor              # diagnose config, DB connection, and provider health
```

Agent tasks (scheduled cron jobs via APScheduler) are in-process and will restart with the backend. Persistent state lives in Postgres — no in-memory-only state that can be lost on restart.

### Permissions

All resources are scoped **per user**. Agents, memories, CRM contacts, and channel connections are isolated by `user_id` at the database query level — a user cannot read or write another user's data even if they share the same instance.

Role model: `admin` users can manage LLM providers and system-wide settings. Regular users manage only their own agents and data.

### Agent limits

Agents are bounded at multiple layers to prevent runaway behaviour:

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Safety gates** | NemoGuard / Llama-Guard runs before and after every model response. Blocks or redacts harmful content. |
| **PII redaction** | GLiNER-based extraction strips personal data from memory writes and shared context. |
| **Gate logging** | Every gate decision is written to `gate_logs` — auditable, queryable via API. |
| **Tool scope** | Each agent has an explicit tool list. No agent can call a tool it was not granted. |
| **Model overrides** | Per-agent model, temperature, and token limits are set at creation time and not changeable by the agent itself. |
| **Cron throttling** | Scheduled tasks are defined with explicit intervals — no self-scheduling or infinite loops. |

Configure gates under *Settings → Safety* in the dashboard.

---

## ◈ Terminal providers

Two browser-based terminal providers, running in isolated Docker containers with Traefik routing and forward-auth:

**ttyd** — Lightweight Bash/Zsh terminal in the browser. Minimal resource usage. Default for local access.

**wetty** — SSH-in-browser with server-side proxy. Password and key-based auth. Connects to remote Linux/Unix servers with automatic VM credential injection.

Install through the UI under *Settings → Terminal Providers*. No additional setup required.
